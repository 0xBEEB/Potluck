A front-end to the popular Archlinux package manager, pacman. Potluck manages 
updates and new package installs for the user in a convenient Qt4 interface. 
Written in python, potluck takes advantage of the C library functions that are 
a part of pacman. As well as making standard package management more 
convenient, potluck also extends functionality similarly to yaourt to the Arch 
User Repository (AUR) which holds a collection of user submitted build scripts 
for various source tar-balls across the web. Potluck uses the AUR api to 
seamlessly integrate the AUR with the rest of the Archlinux repositories. The 
user can vote on build scripts and create their own. Allowing them to be part 
of the community package "potluck".

Qt Designer - Just some notes on Qt Designer
So I used Qt Designer to create a lot of the ui elements. So, a few commands
need to be run to update the ui files that Qt Designer creates.
$ pyuicy --from-imports mw.ui -o mwUi.py
$ pyuicy --from-imports changes.ui -o changesUi.py
$ pyrcc4 -py3 view/icons.qrc -o icons_rc.py
